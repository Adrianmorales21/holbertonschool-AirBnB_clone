# Holberton School Airbnb clone

## Console?

Is a command line interpreter like the Shell, but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we are able to manage objects in our storage system (JSON file):

    Create a new object (ex a new User or a new Place)
    Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
    Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
    Update attributes of an object
    Destroy an object

The Console is the tool to validate this storage engine
